For a class assignment, I developed a program based on a client brief. 

The program provides the ability to input and view athlete data for the judo club "North Sussex Judo".

Built with Tkinter, I explored input widgets, Frames and SQLite3 for data storage. 
The project also involved implementing algorithms for data validation, storage, and retrieval.

The projects images and code are all included in the file "NSJ" for the program to run.

REQUIREMENTS:
