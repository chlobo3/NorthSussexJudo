For a class assignment, I developed a program based on a client brief. 
This program provides the ability to input and view athlete data for the judo club "North Sussex Judo".

Built with Tkinter, I explored input widgets, Frames and SQLite3 for data storage. 
The project also involved implementing algorithms for data validation, storage, and retrieval.
